When it comes to deploying a codebase, there are several deployment strategies or approaches to consider. The choice of deployment strategy depends on the application's architecture, development practices, team requirements, and infrastructure capabilities. Here are some common types of deployment for a codebase:

1. Continuous Deployment: Continuous Deployment is an approach where changes to the codebase are automatically deployed to the production environment as soon as they pass through the automated build, test, and deployment pipeline. This approach aims to deliver new features and bug fixes quickly and frequently.

2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD is an extension of continuous deployment, where code changes are continuously integrated, tested, and deployed to production. It involves using automated build, test, and deployment pipelines to ensure that every code change is thoroughly validated before being deployed.

3. Manual Deployment: In a manual deployment process, code changes are deployed to the production environment manually by a developer or operations team member. This typically involves following a set of deployment instructions or running scripts to deploy the application.

4. [[Staged Deployment]]: Staged deployment involves deploying the codebase in multiple stages or environments, such as development, testing, staging, and production. Each stage serves a specific purpose, such as testing new features, validating performance, or simulating production conditions. Code changes are deployed to each stage sequentially, allowing for thorough testing and validation before reaching the production environment.

5. Blue-Green Deployment: In a blue-green deployment, two identical environments, referred to as "blue" and "green," are set up. The production traffic is initially routed to the blue environment, while the green environment is updated with the new codebase or changes. Once the green environment is fully tested and ready, the traffic is switched from blue to green, making the green environment the new production environment. This approach allows for zero-downtime deployments and easy rollback if issues arise.

6. Canary Deployment: Canary deployment is a strategy where a small percentage of the production traffic is routed to the new code changes or features while the majority of the traffic still goes to the existing stable version. This approach allows for gradual testing and validation of new changes in production and minimizes the impact in case of any issues.

These deployment strategies can be combined or customized based on the specific needs and requirements of the project. It's important to consider factors such as scalability, performance, reliability, and risk management when selecting the appropriate deployment strategy for a codebase.
