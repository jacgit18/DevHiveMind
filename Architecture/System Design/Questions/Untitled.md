Using this as a template come up with clean values that result in clean mathematical results make easier to make estimations

#### Usage Assumption to trace out math calculation

200,000,000 active user

##### Comments
2 comments per user on average a month

Total monthly comments: 2 comments per user * 200,000,000 users = 400,000,000 comments

Overall comments per day: Total monthly comments / 30 days  = 13,000,000 round down for cleaner math 

Comments per second in a day = Overall comments per day / Total seconds in a day

Comments per second in a day = 13,000,000 / 86,400  ≈ 150 round down

###### Storage Estimation Monthly

Total storage needed = Average comment size(assumption) * Total monthly comments 

Total storage needed = 1,024 bytes * 13,000,000 comments = 13,312,000,000 bytes

13,312,000,000 bytes / 1024 bytes = 13,000,000  KB 

13,000,000 KB / 1024 KB/MB = 12,695.3125 MB(approximately)

###### Network Estimation Monthly
Total network traffic for comments:
400,000,000 comments * 1 KB Average comment size(assumption) = 400,000,000 KB 

400,000,000 KB / 1024 KB/MB ≈ 390,625 MB

Daily network traffic for comments = 390,625 MB / 30 ≈ 13,020.83 MB per day


###### Memory Estimation Monthly
Read requests per day = Total network traffic for comments in month / days in a month

Read requests per day = 400,000,000 comments / 30 = 13,000,000 comments rounded down

Memory Total metadata overhead : Read requests per day \* average request size \* 20%


Memory Total metadata overhead  = 13,000,000 * 500 bytes(assumption) * 20% = 1,300,000,000 bytes

Cache for Youtube comments:  (13 million requests \* 500 bytes) = 6.05 GB

Adjusted cache: (20% of 6.05 GB) = 1.21 GB

Total memory: (1.21 GB * 3 for replication) = 3.63 GB replicating database cache


###### Ratio(Side Note)
Storage to memory ratio = Storage estimation / Memory estimation

12,695.3125 MB = 12.40625 GB

Storage to memory ratio = 12.40625 GB / 3.63 GB ≈ 3.42 GB

A ratio of approximately 3.42 indicates that the storage estimation is higher than the memory estimation.

Ratio = 3.63 GB / 12.40625 GB ≈ 0.2925
Percentage Ratio = 0.2925 * 100% ≈ 29.25%


##### Likes
120 likes per user in a month between shorts and regular videos

Total monthly likes: 120 likes per user * 30 days * 200,000,000 users = 720,000,000,000 likes

Overall likes per day: Total monthly likes / 30 days  = 24,000,000,000 likes


Likes per second in a day = Total likes in a day / Total seconds in a day

Likes per second in a day = 24,000,000,000 likes / 86,400 seconds = 277,777.77 likes

###### Storage Estimation Monthly
Total storage needed = Average likes size(assumption) * Total monthly likes 

Video ID (11 bytes) + User ID (16 bytes) + JSON overhead (10 bytes) = 37 bytes

Total storage needed = 37 bytes * 720,000,000,000  likes = 26,640,000,000,000 bytes


26,640,000,000,000 bytes / 1024 bytes/KB * 1024 KB/MB = 26,640,000,000,000 bytes / 1,048,576 = 25,402,832.03125 MB

25,402,832.03125 MB / 1024 MB/GB = 25,000 GB (approximately)

###### Network Estimation Monthly
Total network traffic for Likes:
720,000,000,000 likes * 1 KB Average likes size(assumption) = 720,000,000,000 KB 

720,000,000,000 KB / 1024 KB/MB ≈ 703,125,000 MB

###### Memory Estimation Monthly

Read requests per day = Total network traffic for likes in month / days in a month

Read requests per day = 720,000,000,000 likes / 30 days = 24,000,000,000 likes per day

Memory Total metadata overhead: Read requests per day * average request size * 20%

Memory Total metadata overhead = 24,000,000,000 likes per day * 500 bytes (assumption) * 20% = 2,400,000,000,000 bytes

Cache for Youtube comments: (2,400,000,000,000 bytes / 1024^4 bytes) = 2.2332 TB

Adjusted cache: (20% of 2.2332 TB) = 446.64 GB

Total memory: (446.64 GB * 3 for replication) = 1.339 GB replicating database cache



##### Views
100 views per user a month shorts and regular videos

Total monthly views = 100 * active users * 30 days = 30,000,000

Overall daily views per day(shorts and regular videos): Monthly views/ 30 days = 1,000,000 views

Views per second in a day = Total views in a day / Total seconds in a day

Views per second in a day = 1,000,000 views / 86,400 seconds ≈ 11.5741 views per second

###### Storage Estimation Monthly

Total storage needed = Average view counts size(assumption) * Total monthly view counts  

Total storage needed = 4 bytes * 30,000,000 view counts  = 120,000,000 bytes

120,000,000 bytes / 1024 bytes = 117,187.5 KB 

117,187.5 KB / 1024 KB/MB = 114.44 MB (approximately)

###### Network Estimation Monthly

Total network traffic for view counts:
30,000,000 view counts * 1 KB Average view counts size(assumption) = 30,000,000 KB 

30,000,000 KB / 1024 KB/MB ≈ 30,000 MB

###### Memory Estimation Monthly

Read requests per day = Total network traffic for view counts in month / days in a month

Read requests per day = 30,000,000 view counts / 30 days = 1,000,000 view counts per day

Memory Total metadata overhead: Read requests per day * average request size * 20%

Memory Total metadata overhead = 1,000,000 view counts per day * 500 bytes (assumption) * 20% = 100,000,000 bytes per day

Cache for Youtube view counts: (100,000,000 bytes / 1024^3 bytes) ≈ 0.0931 GB

Adjusted cache: (20% of 0.0931 GB) ≈ 0.0186 GB

Total memory: (0.0186 GB * 3 for replication) ≈ 0.0558 GB replicating database cache

### Total Estimation

#### Storage

Comments + Likes + View Counts
19.53 MB +   + 114.44 MB OG calculation

12,695.3125 MB +  25,000 GB + 114.44 MB more realistic

25,000 GB * 1024 MB/GB = 25,600,000 MB

Now, add the sizes together:

Total Storage Needed = 12,695.3125 MB + 25,600,000 MB + 114.44 MB

Total Storage Needed = 25,612,809.7525 MB

25,612,809.7525 MB/ 1024 MB/GB ≈ 25,000 GB = 25 TB

#### Network 
Comments + Likes + View Counts

390,625 MB + 703,125,000 MB + 30,000 MB = 703,546,625 MB = 670 TB

#### Memory
Comments + Likes + View Counts
3.63 GB + 1.339 GB + 0.0558 GB = 5.0248 GB

#### Bandwidth

Bandwidth required = (200,000,000  * 1.5 MB) = 300,000,000 MB

Bandwidth per second = Bandwidth required / 86,400 seconds in a day = 3,472.22 MB/s = 3.39 GB
