## Modifiers 
 Access modifiers are keywords in certain languages that help to restrict the scope of ***attributes, classes, methods,and constructors (member):***

- **no-modifier** - this is `default` to what is known as "*package-private*" making it visible only within its packages (named groups of related classes).

### UML Class Signs

 ```java
 * Mandidtory  
 O Optional
```
>[!note] Example 
> "astrick sign" function-name
> 0 function-name

-  **public** - code is accessible from everywhere in the program and from outside classes. 
```java
+ public
```

### Private
- The `private` access modifier serves the essential purpose of restricting access to class members, which includes both variables and methods within the same class where they are defined. When a member is declared as `private`, it can only be accessed and modified within the class in which it is defined. This encapsulation effectively hides these members from other classes and objects. 

- Private members play a crucial role in upholding the principle of encapsulation by concealing the internal implementation details of a class. This not only helps in maintaining data integrity but also prevents direct manipulation of the class's internal state by external code, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and security of the program or system.
```java
- private
```

>[!note] 
>Side note to test a private method, create an instance of that class and try to print the output of the variable or method that was private.
>
> You could try to call the private method in a class that should have access and asserts that the call failed.


- [[Protected in Depth |Protected]] - member can only be accessed within its package and by a subclass of its class in another package used a lot with `UUID`.
```java
# protected
```

>[!note] Side Note
>Your access modifier strategy should use the most restrictive access level that makes sense for the specific member.  Also, avoid public fields except for constants.


## Non-Access Modifiers 

**These are the non-access modifiers for classes: 

- **Abstract** - class cannot be used to create objects. 
- **Final** - class cannot be inherited by other classes. 

**These are the non-access modifiers for attributes and methods: 

- **Abstract** - only be used in an abstract class and can only be used on methods. 

- **Final** - both cannot be overridden or modified. 
  
- [[Static methods |Static]]- both belong to the class and not the object. also in uml is represented by being underlined and a little bold. static members are used so, there will be one and only one copy of the member.
 
- **Transient** - both are skipped when serializing the object containing them. 
 
- **Synchronized** - methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time. 

- **Volatile** - the value of an attribute is read from main memory and not cached thread-locally.
