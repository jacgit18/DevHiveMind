## Abstraction
  - The function and uses of a class are known
  - The actual implementation is hidden from the user.
    - This can be done using an abstract class or an Interface to define the behavior of a class without implementing it.
  - Abstraction can be achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.
  - Deferring the behavior of an object to its child classes
## Abstract Class vs. Interface

- What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
  - An abstract class permits you to make a functionality that subclasses can implement or override
  - An interface only permits you to state functionality but not to implement it.
  - A class can extend only one abstract class, while a class can implement multiple interfaces.
  - An abstract class is a class that contains the keyword abstract, while an Interface is a class with a method without a body that uses the keyword implement.
  - Neither creates an object in java.

## Inheritance vs. Abstraction

- What are the differences between inheritance and abstraction?
  - The key difference between the two principles lies in how abstraction focuses on the privacy of functionality, while inheritance focuses on sharing functionality (and reusability).

Abstract classes typically feature the abstract keyword in their declaration and should contain at least one abstract method, i.e., a method without a body. They can also have multiple concrete methods. The inheriting classes are obliged to implement the abstract methods, ensuring a consistent structure across subclasses.

The key reasons for using abstract classes include:

1. Offering default functionality for subclasses.
2. Providing a template for future specific classes.
3. Defining a common interface for its subclasses.
4. Facilitating code reusability.

In the context of Java, abstraction is the process of presenting only essential information to a user. This abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces. The keyword "abstract" is used for classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be used to create objects; access is only granted through inheritance. Abstract methods, which lack a method body, can only be used in abstract classes. These abstract classes can contain a combination of abstract and regular methods.
